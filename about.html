            <p>CleverMount is a family-founded school that opened in November 2022 out of passion for quality education in Rwanda's less privileged areas.</p>
            <p>Inspired by our daughters' experiences in boarding school and the desire for our youngest son, Valentin, to have access to quality education without sacrificing precious family time as a young boy, we embarked on this journey. Indeed, God used Valentin to ignite a passion we have always had as a family.</p>
            <p>Our goal is twofold:</p>
            <p>To provide quality education and benefit the community, addressing the challenges of family separation for education and lack of quality education opportunities for many children in Rwanda's rural communities, starting from Rulindo district. We believe that foundations are core and our call is to build solid foundations for future generations.</p>
            <p>Since November 2022, Clevermount has impacted over 175 students with over 50 students successfully graduated. Our curriculum emphasizes competency-based learning, fostering skills in reading, writing, public speaking, math, and critical thinking from an early age.</p>

        <div class="header">Our Commitment to Sustainability</div>
        <div class="info">
            <p>At CleverMount, we believe that quality education must be built on a foundation of self-sustenance. Our commitment to creating a secure educational environment is achieved through agricultural initiatives that support our school's operations and provide practical employment opportunities for our the community.</p>
            <p>We are dedicated to establishing a self-sustaining educational model through:</p>
            <p><strong>Agricultural Integration:</strong>Our campus features productive pig, poultry, and cattle farms that serve multiple purposes. These facilities provide food for our students while generating income to support school operations and scholarships.</p>
            <p><strong>Financial Stability:</strong>By developing these agricultural enterprises, we are creating a reliable revenue stream that reduces dependency on external funding and ensures consistent educational quality regardless of economic fluctuations. This model allows us to maintain affordable tuition rates while still offering excellent education.</p>
            <p><strong>Community Development:</strong>Our sustainability model extends beyond the classroom by providing employment opportunities for local community members (starting from the parents of our most vulnerable students) and sharing agricultural expertise with families in the Rulindo district since the school farms serve as demonstration sites for improved farming techniques.</p>
            <p>By embedding this self-sustaining approach into our educational foundation, we're not just providing immediate education but building a model that ensures CleverMount can continue to serve generations of students with excellence and stability long into the future.</p>
