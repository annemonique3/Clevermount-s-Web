# Clevermount-s-Web
This depository contains a project that encompasses designing and building a website for a CleverMount school, a school in Rwanda, Northern Province, Rulindo District, Tumba Sector. The website will provide essential information about the school, including its history and academic programs and help raise donations, while showcasing its ongoing sustainability projects through an embedded project management dashboard. The dashboard will enable stakeholders to track project progress, provide updates, and collect feedback.
Attaining this involves: 
Frontend: 
The website will be built using Wix.com to ensure a professional presentation with minimum development. 
The design is to ensure the website is accessible on various devices (ie.laptops, desktops, mobile phones).  
Backend: 
APIs will manage project data and updates, enabling real time synchronization with the dashboard. 
Tableau will be used to create the dashboard that will later be embedded on to the website. 

The project involves Aplha, Beta, and RC milestones and details to these are listed under Milestones and attached to their respective issues.
