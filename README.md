# Clevermount-s-Web
This depository contains a project that encompasses designing and building a website for a CleverMount school, a school in Rwanda, Northern Province, Rulindo District, Tumba Sector. The website will provide essential information about the school, including its history and academic programs and help raise donations, while showcasing its ongoing sustainability projects through an embedded project management dashboard. The dashboard will enable stakeholders to track project progress, provide updates, and collect feedback.

Attaining this involves: 

Frontend(HTML, CSS, JavaScript): 
The website will be built and styled using html, CSS, and JavaScript. I may also use React and Bootstrap to increase interactivity and ensure responsive design across devices.

Backend(Tableau,Python): 
The dashboard will be created in Tableau and Python will help in integrating data and embedding the dashboard.

Datasets: 
All the data used will be derived from CleverMountâ€™s budgets. If necessary, I will add more data expanding on the available to increase the amount of data used. 

The project involves Aplha, Beta, and RC milestones and details to these are listed under Milestones and attached to their respective issues.
