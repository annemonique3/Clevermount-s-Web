            CleverMount is a family-founded school that opened in November 2022 out passion for quality education in Rwanda's less 
            privileged areas. 
            Inspired by our daughters'experiences in boarding school and the desire 
            for our youngest son, Valentin, to have access to quality education without sacrificing precious family time as 
            a young boy, we embarked on this journey. Indeed, God used Valentin to ignite a passion we have always had as a family.

            Our goal is twofold: 
            
            To provide quality education and benefit the community, addressing the challenges of family 
            separation for education and lack of quality education opportunities for many children in Rwanda's rural communities.
            We believe that foundations are core and our call is to build solid foundations for future generations.

            Since November 2022, Clevermount has impacted over 175 students with over 50 students successfully graduated. Our curriculum emphasizes on 
            competency-based learning, fostering skills in reading, writing, public speaking, math, and critical thinking from an early age.
